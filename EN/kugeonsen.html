                                The technical term for this is the "Tonochi Effect," which refers to the stimulating effect of going to an onsen resort and getting a boost in blood circulation from
                                the unique chemical ingredients of the hot springs, eating the local seasonal food, and walking through the scenery and streets that you would not normally see.<br>
                                This is one of the effects that can be felt in any hot spring resort, but here in Gero Onsen, there are many things to see and do when strolling around town, so you can
                                expect a greater tipping point effect.<br>
                                If you're looking for a break from years of accumulated stress, this is also a great place to visit.<br>
